Non Volatile Memory

The SST25 memory chip is needed to store the sound used by the chess game. It has a SPI interface so an SPI module is used.
The comunnication is straightfoward as explained in the datasheed.Some functions are added to encapsulate the memory chip, these are the initialization, byteRead, blockRead, byteWrite, blockWrite, chipErase, the name is self-explanatory. Most of the time the chip is just read in blocks to refil the audio buffer and that's all there is just a call to readBlock in  the audio routine.
