The kind of video interface chosen was VGA, because it has the horizotal and vertical sync signals 'separados' from the image signal.That's impportant to get a good framing of the image. This routine would be realy heavy for a 40MIPS processor if it was bit-banged, but using the SPI and DMA modules it was reduced to about 10% of the processor time.
With a limited RAM from the processor (16k) the resolution of the image must be gratly reduced. The chossen resolution where 800x600 pixels 60Hz, this is a standart resolution and every monitor suports it.Another reason to chose this image was its pixel clock of 40MHz ( frequency the pixels are serialized trough the rgb sinals).To reduce memory consuption the internal buffer just store a 200x150 image, this is upscaled by running the SPI at one quarter of the pixel clock,and repeating each line in the display 4 times.Mo nocromatic image so the buffer and bandwith requirements are low. With this considerations the buffer is reduced to 4Kbytes ( you must double this number becuse duble buffering is used) giving plenty memory for the other routines to run.

Some graphical routines are added such as: plotLine,plotDot,plotSquare,plotCircle.They modfy the video buffer encapsulating the video module so the user does not need to handle the buffer. Text routines are added so text can be placed in the screen on the fly. A BBT ( bit block transfer ) routine places a char anywhere in the screen even if the position is not  byte aligned with the buffer.
