Lets's play chess?

This project is a micro controller chess game. The objective has to be able to play chess on a VGA monitor, including an intelligent computer to play against. This should all be accomplished with a micro controller. 

I started this as a project  for the college ( I am a Electrical Engineering student ), but it has grow way beyond that. Now it is a complete chess game with a video output, keyboard for user interface, audio for some sound effects, a clock, a temperature meter. All the code was written from scratch,  so any questions about the code you can ask me. I took a lot of time to write all this down, and to make the video and audio routines. The code is all well commented (almost all in English) and modular, it shouldn't be hard to understand.

The source code was all divided in simple modules, so it's easy to debug and re-use. Some cool techniques where used in the routines that are worth a look. The division of the source code is as follows :
Audio
Keyboard
Video
Graphics Routines
Serial
Temperature sensing
External Flash Memory (NVM)
Real Time Clock and Calendar (RTCC)
Analog Clock
Chess Engine
Chess Human Interface
Chess Graphics
Conway's Game of Life
Each section of the code is explained in the next Steps of the instructable, the entire code is huge (108 pages)  but simple. The routines are written in a non-blocking way, so adding more stuff it's 

In the end i had a nice game, not so hard but funny.
