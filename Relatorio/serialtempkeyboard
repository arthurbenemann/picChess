The serial, temperature and keybord routines are simple, just some input output routines. A smal overview of this functions is presented below , for more information you can look at the code or ask me.

Temperature Routine

There is just one function readTemp() that uses the adc to get a value from the LM35 sensor.This value is then Scaled to get a 10 couts per ºC integer that represents the current temperature.

Serial Routine

Just used to send characteres or string via the RS232 connection to a pc, mainly used for debugging.

Keyboard

This routine is fully indepent using it's self interruptions to handle the keyboard comunnication. Data sent by the keyboard is decoded and processed in this module and the values are saved in a circular FIFO buffer.The main function just need to use getKey to receive the last key pressed.
